# Github Profile Search App Tutorial Project

This project was done following along with a learn React tutorial. It's not an original project but was very good to create in order to learn the concepts of React. Keeping this in my GitHub so that I can refer to it in the future if needed.

This app allows users to search for GitHub users via the GitHub API. Once a user is selected from the user search results, their profile details and most recent repositories will be displayed.

Feel free to test it out and see what it does!

## Usage

### Dependencies

This app uses Tailwind and React.

### Run

npm run dev

This will run React on port :3000

### Notes

The GitHub API limits the number of requests to 10 requests per minute.
